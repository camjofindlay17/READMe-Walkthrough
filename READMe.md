## Description

This project creates a professional READMe for the user.

## Installation

In order to run the program, the user must install the Inquirer package through their command line. This can be done by opening their terminal and entering “npm i inquirer” in the command line.

## Usage

The user is given a series of prompts in the command line and asked to add any pertinent information that they would like to share regarding their application. The prompts include a Title, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions section. Some of the sections require information to be entered, or the user will be unable to move to the next prompt. Once the user has gone through all of the prompts, a READMe markdown file will be created in their designated folder.
